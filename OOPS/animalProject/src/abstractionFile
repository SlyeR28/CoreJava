all about abstraction in java

abstraction is a pillar of oops in which we hide the data and show only useful to client or users
if you want initialize a class as abstract you have to put abstract keyword in place of public
abstract class can provide the abstract methods so that you can easily implement it to other classes by extending it
it solves the problem of multiple inheritance problem in java as it only provide the method so its subclasses can override
it by its own implementations
we can put instance variable with access modifiers
we can also have concerete methods in abstract class
we can not create object of abstract class
we can not create static method in abstract class
abstract class can have have constructors getter setter but constructors cannot assigned with final abstract keywords
parent class can set the properties of its subclass but only these instance variables that are provided in parent class only not
of its subclass properties
