interface are blueprint for class
they provides methods that can be implemented by class by implements keyword
if we declare any variable in interfaces they by nature are final and static
in interface after java 8 we can have static methods but they only used by interface name
if we want to add some methods in interface they can be done by default keyword
multiple  inheritance  problem is solved by interface not purely but partially
