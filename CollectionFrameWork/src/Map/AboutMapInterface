represesnts a collections of key-value pair
no duplicates keys are allowed but values can be duplicated
only one key can null but in different impletes like hashmap and linked hashmap

if you re using the hashmap there you dont have garauntee of intersertion order
in hashtable you cant directly use the sort method b/c of hashmap is unordered
but you use sort by converting the hashmap to list it can easily sort them

  // Convert to list of entries
        List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>(map.entrySet());
